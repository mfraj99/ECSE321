# Welcome to Group 8's Pet Adoption App project!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2020/project-group-08.svg?token=VBu3P4oyjgHgd1q2Qycx&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2020/project-group-08)

This project was created as part of the course ECSE321 - Introduction to Software Engineering in Winter 2020 at McGill University.

Due to covid-19 only the backend was able to be completed.

Our team was composed of:
* [Michael Frajman](https://github.com/mfraj99) - Project manager and document lead
* [Karl Koerich](https://github.com/karlmiko) - Backend developer
* [Shi Tong Li](https://github.com/link825) - Testing lead
* [Xinrui Li](https://github.com/xinruili07) - Frontend developer
* [Jia Wei Sun](https://github.com/jiaweisun-github) - Backend developer and UML specialist

## Scope
The goal of the project was to create a website and app for a pet shelter that allowed for users to view and apply to adoption posts as well as to put their pets up for adoption. Spring was used as a framework with PostGreSQL and Hibernate for the database.
